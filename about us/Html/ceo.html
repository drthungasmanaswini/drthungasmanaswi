      At a personal level, almost everyone has a story about healthcare. Many of these stories have a happy ending and reveal extraordinary skill and compassion of doctors and caregivers. Too often, however, the happy endings were due to the personal determination, connections, and ongoing intervention of family members.</h5>
     <p class="card-text">
      Redefining healthcare that meets the individual needs of patients that is both safe and affordable is an ongoing challenge and has become an increasingly elusive target for both the developed and developing countries. At the American Mission Hospital, this has been a core value that has defined us from our humble beginnings in the early 1900s serving the people of Bahrain through the decades. Today healthcare and its safe delivery is complex and needs the seamless integration of multiple systems and processes to achieve the desired outcome at an affordable cost, AMH is committed to this.
      <br/>
      My role is to ensure that the execution of our mission is patient-focused, safe and exceeds patient expectations in all dimensions. I bring to AMH more than 25 years of healthcare experience gained at leading hospitals in London, United States, and Saudi Aramco and am confident that with the professionals we have at AMH we will continue to be a leader in defining healthcare in Bahrain.
     <br/>
