            The American Mission Hospital N.P.C.  is a private not-for-profit hospital located in Manama, Bahrain. It has been serving the community of Bahrain for over 120 years.

Established in 1903, as the Mason Memorial Hospital, it was the first modern hospital in Bahrain, and in fact, in the entire gulf region of Arabia. </p>

<p class="par">
Today, the hospital offers general and specialist medical & dental services from its main branch in Manama, and also from clinics in Saar, Amwaj Islands, and Riffa. 

In A’Ali, with the opening of King Hamad American Mission Hospital (KHAMH),  on 26 January 2023, the hospital system or network has expanded.

AMH is, therefore, now serving Bahrain from FIVE locations - Manama, Amwaj, Saar, Rifaa and A'Ali (KHAMH)

The Manama, Saar, and the new A'Ali branches are open 24x7.
          </p>
 <h5 class="card-title">Governance:</h5>
 <p class="par">
    As a not-for-profit organization, the hospital does not have any shareholders who seek any profits from its operations.

The management of the hospital reports to a board of directors - which comprises Reformed Church in America (RCA) officials, former ambassadors, management professionals from multinational companies, and experts in healthcare – from USA and Bahrain.

The hospital is an independent not-for-profit hospital, serving only in Bahrain.</p>

</div>
<p class="par">
It has no branches outside Bahrain, and does not report to any organization from outside Bahrain. As a law-abiding organization, it follows the rules and regulations of the Kingdom of Bahrain

The hospital’s values are its Christian roots and ethos. 

Its mission - of providing healthcare on the biblical principles of compassion, grace, and love - remains unchanged over the 120 years of its service to the people of Bahrain.

<h5 class="card-title">Accreditations:</h5>
<p class="par">
    Consecutively, in 2017 and 2021, the hospital in Manama and its clinics in Saar, Amwaj Islands and Riffa have been awarded Diamond Status – the highest level of accreditation given to hospitals by the National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA) of Bahrain. 

Over a decade earlier, in 2007, AMH had actually become the first hospital in the Kingdom of Bahrain to have achieved a global quality accreditation in healthcare. It was through ACHS International (ACHSI), Australia's leading health care accreditation agency, which is recognised by the International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua), for its standards and for its accreditations programs. The accreditation had also been reaffirmed by ACHSI in 2010, showing the hospital's commitment to quality improvement. 

The hospital currently has the certifications of ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 for the Provision of In-patient and Out-patient Medical Services including Training, Dental, Diagnostic and Pharmacy Services from Bureau Veritas, UK.
 It had had the OHSAS 18001:2007 earlier.

In May 2021, AMH became the first private hospital in Bahrain to achieve the CAP accreditation, for its Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, from the College of American Pathologists, Illinois, USA. 

With this CAP accreditation, it also became the second hospital in the country - after the government's King Hamad University Hospital - to achieve this recognition.  

In May 2023, the hospital received CAP accreditation once again, from the College of American Pathologists, for the second time consecutively

    <h5 class="card-title">Wellness:</h5>
    <p class="par">
        AMH is among the first hospitals in Bahrain to focus on wellness and preventative health, instead of on illness alone. 

The Riffa clinic, which opened in 2018, has a Wellness Center, with a large portion of its facility allocated to health and fitness training. The trainers provide wellness advice, with health and fitness packages, that benefit our patients and members.
 The place has a well-equipped gym, a large indoor swimming pool, and other facilities.</p>

With AMH’s willingness and readiness to promote preventative health strategies and lifestyle changes, in Bahrain, the hospital regularly conducts walkathons and other health initiatives.

The hospital also facilitates Corporate Wellness Programs for companies interested in giving their staff a priority in healthcare and lifestyle improvements.
